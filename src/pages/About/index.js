                <p>
                    My name is Elize and i am a self-taught Front-End Developer. During the fall of
                    2021 after a few months of hobby coding i completed the Front-End Engineering
                    course on CodeCademy and although it was challenging, as only coding can be, i
                    loved every minute of it. Since March this year i've been doing my internship in
                    a real work environment and i am now ready for the next step in my career. I
                    strive to be a better developer every day and looking forward to a fun and
                    exciting career as a developer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would concider myself a outgoing and happy person with a hunger for knowledge.
                    In my free time i like to listen and dance to music (not professionally but in
                    my livingroom), meet friends and family and travel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've worked my way up the knowledge ladder and will continue to do so and
                    hopefully i can become one of the best in my field one day.
